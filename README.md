# A simple aiohttp and aiomysql demo

##Setting everything up:
__1.__ Create mysql database and import init_db.sql. This is phpmyadmin-generated dump of the test database without any data. I e it contains only structure. Note that maybe you will have to change manually encoding before import for every table if you want to use utf8 (the default charset was set to latin1)

__2.__ Edit main.py and fill aiomysql.create_pool(...) function call with actual database credentials.

__3.__ Run __pip install -r requirements.txt__

__4.__ To start app simply run  __python main.py__ By default the app listens on 127.0.0.1 port 8080 (You will be noticed it after app launch - just check the console

# Routes

To add data you can post json to (beware of content-type header!):

/addstore - to add new store. Example payload: {"name":"Test 2", "address": "test address"}

/additem - example payload: {"name":"6th item", "price": 1.6}

/addsale - to link one sale and store - example payload: {"store_id":18,"item_id":4}

Every successful request will return 200 OK with corresponding new record id wrapped in json. Every wrong request will result in 500 Error - then you can look for the actual reason to the server's console log

Working example: You can use curl for posting data e.g. run __curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data '{"name":"Test curl store","address":"localhost"}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/addstore__

To get data:

all stores - /stores

all items - /items

Top 10 selling stores (with actual income) within last 30 days. /top10shops

10 bestselling items across all time - /top10items

Working example: Simply run __curl http://127.0.0.1/stores__
